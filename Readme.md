# Title
Probabilistic Analysis of Ventures

# Description
Business ventures are undertaken by investing capital in projects with the expectation of a profit. Each venture has a probability distribution of returns and a business generally has multiple active ventures at any time.

The goal of this project is to determine how the breakeven probability of the portfolio varies with the number of ventures and the probability distributions of individual ventures.

- Variation in the probability of at least 1 success with both variables
